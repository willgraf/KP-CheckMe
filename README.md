# KPCheckMe

2nd Place Entry in the 2015 Health and Wellness Codeathon

KP CheckMe is a decision support web application which helps members decide whether or not they should pursue medical care.

Users login, are prompted for their symptoms, and are given personalized advice.

If needed, they may even order an Uber via the API to their physician's office directly from the webapp.
